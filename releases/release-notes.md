# Source Code Flattener v1.5.1 Release Notes

## Overview

Version 1.5.1 introduces significant improvements to streamline the output format of the Source Code Flattener extension. With this update, we've consolidated what were previously separate output files into a single comprehensive file, making it easier to work with flattened code.

## Key Improvements

- **Consolidated Output**: All flattened source code and analysis information now output to a single `*_flattened.md` file instead of separate files
- **Dependency Visualization**: Added Mermaid diagrams at the end of the output file to visualize dependencies between files
- **Improved Navigation**: Enhanced table of contents with navigation links to specific files
- **Better Organization**: Added anchor links for improved navigation within the flattened code document

## Installation

You can install this extension directly from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GiuseppeTuritto.source-code-flattener) or by downloading the VSIX file from this release.

## Known Issues

No known issues with this release.
